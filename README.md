## About Me

I hold a Bachelors's degree in Mechanical engineering with a [Google cloud certification](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/3befdf67-850d-4950-b8df-db6c57ee4bda) in machine learning. My passion for machine learning and MLOps stems from my curiosity to unearth hidden patterns within data. I leverage these insights to build and manage machine learning models that solve complex problems and drive real-world business impact. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can continuously learn and apply my analytical skills.
